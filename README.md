# create-nuxt3-enterprise

Nuxt 3 starter that includes all you need to build amazing enterprise projects 🔥

## Getting started

To generate a new nuxt 3 enterprise project:

```bash
npx create-nuxt3-enterprise
```

## Features
- official nuxt directory structure out of the box 📂
- eslint/prettier config 💜
- pinia state management 🍍
- histoire for user stories 📗
- zod for schema validation 💎
- pages 📄
- API routes 🗄️
- server middlewares 🔀
- components 🧩
- layouts 🎨
- useHead 👤
- nav component 🗺️
- vitest testing 🧪

## Motivation

Currently, default Nuxt 3 scaffolding through Nuxi only creates basic files like App.vue, nuxt.config, etc. Every time I'm starting a new project I had to recreate the directory structure from scratch with pages, assets, layouts, components composables, etc. Also, there were some repetitive and mundane tasks I had to do every single time like setting eslint/prettier, useHead, pinia store, so I came up with the idea to create a starter for every Nuxt project with the features I'm installing and setting up every time I am starting a new project.
